NAME="perl-PPI"
VERSION=1.215
RELEASE=1
CATEGORY="Perl"
SUMMARY="Perl parser module"
DESCRIPTION="The purpose of PPI is not to parse Perl *code*, but to parse Perl
*documents*. By treating the problem this way, we are able to parse a single
file containing Perl source code isolated from any other resources, such as
libraries upon which the code may depend, and without needing to run an
instance of perl alongside or inside the parser."
